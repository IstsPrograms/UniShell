How to create custom commands.
1. It is necessary to use the `CmdAttrLib` project located in the directory of the same name.
2. Create a library type project, add the `CmdAttrLib` project as dependencies.
3. Commands must use the `ICommand` interface. It is allowed to create several commands in one project.
4. Compile and use the .dll file.
In order for the commands to be automatically loaded when UniShell starts, you need to place the .dll file in the packages directory located in the root directory.
Here is an example command:
```cs
public class Hello : ICommand
{
    public string Name { get; set; } = "hello";
    public string Description { get; set; } = "Hello world command";
    public int Execute(string args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
        return 0;
    }
}
```
